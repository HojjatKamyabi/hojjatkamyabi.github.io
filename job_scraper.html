<p>This project is about understanding what tech skills companies are looking for in different parts of Germany. I used data from LinkedIn job posts and turned it into an interactive map that shows which skills are most popular in each region.</p>

<h2>What’s the Goal?</h2>
<p>To help job seekers and recruiters see which tech skills are in high demand based on location, so they can make better decisions about where to apply, hire, or upskill.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The project has three main steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Collect Data:</strong> I built a Python web scraper to pull job postings from LinkedIn. It saves the job title, description, location, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Extract Skills:</strong> Using text analysis, the scraper detects tech skills mentioned in each job description. I used tools like regex and fuzzy matching (RapidFuzz) to make it accurate.</li>
    <li><strong>Visualize the Results:</strong> All the data is stored in PostgreSQL and connected to a Power BI dashboard. The map shows how popular each skill is by city or state. When you hover over a region, it shows the top skill and its count.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools I Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Python</strong> – for scraping and cleaning data</li>
    <li><strong>BeautifulSoup & Selenium</strong> – to extract content from job pages</li>
    <li><strong>Apache Airflow</strong> – to automate the whole process on a schedule</li>
    <li><strong>Docker</strong> – to containerize everything so it runs smoothly</li>
    <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> – as the database for all cleaned job and skill data</li>
    <li><strong>Power BI</strong> – to build the interactive dashboard</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Can See in the PowerBI Dashboard</h2>
<ul>
	<li>KPIS, including, most in demand skill in all states, total skills extracted , and last scrape time.</li>
    <li>A map of Germany showing demand for skills like Python, SQL, AWS, etc. in different states.</li>
    <li>Hovering over a location shows the most requested skill and how many times it appeared</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Understanding job market trends helps professionals focus on the right skills and find better job opportunities. This tool makes that easier by showing the data in a simple, visual way.</p>
